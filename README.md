TicTacToe 

This is a command-line version of the game TicTacToe. 
It has adjustable board size and adjustable symbol which you use to tick.
So you can play the classic tictactoe on 3x3 board but you could also try something fun like 7x8 board.
The game also has adjustable symbols for ticking so you wont have to always use 'X' and 'O'.

ATTENTION! It requires the external java library "JANSI" in order to work. You can download the library from this link:
